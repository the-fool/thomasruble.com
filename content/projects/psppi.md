The [Paul Simon Public Policy Institute](http://paulsimoninstitute.siu.edu/) takes an annual poll of public opinion in Illinois.  To help them get the results out, my partner Shiloh Deitz and I made an interactive data-exploration tool.  

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/the-fool/psppi).  It is a Django backend (with the excellent [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)) and an Angular front-end.
